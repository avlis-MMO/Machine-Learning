# Machine Learning Practice Projects

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Practice Projects** repository, where I've compiled a collection of Python scripts showcasing the application of machine learning techniques. These projects reflect the knowledge I've acquired about machine learning, ranging from testing and experimenting with classifiers to delving into preprocessing and other advanced concepts. 

## Projects Overview

This repository houses a diverse compilation of projects that span various aspects of machine learning:

- **Classifier Testing:** Projects where I've experimented with different classifiers to gain insights into their performance and behavior.

- **Pre-processing:** Implementations that focus on data pre-processing, feature engineering, and data transformation techniques.

- **Independent Projects:** The most recent projects were crafted without following existing examples. These represent my evolving understanding and creative application of machine learning principles.
